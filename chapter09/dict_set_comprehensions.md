# Dictionary and Set Comprehensions

General form: `{expression for-clause condition}`

Both dictionary and set comprehensions use curly braces as delimiters.

Dictionary comprehensions are differentiated by the colon used to separate the elements of the expression part of the comprehension.

__set comprehension__
```python
>>> {s for s in [1, 2, 1, 0]}
{0, 1, 2}
```

__dictionary comprehension__
```python
>>> objects = ['blue', 'apple', 'dog']
>>> categories = ['color', 'fruit', 'pet']
>>> {key: value for key, value in zip(categories, objects)}
{'color': 'blue', 'fruit': 'apple', 'pet': 'dog'}
```

Here, `zip()` receives two iterables (`categories` and `objects`) as arguments and makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each iterable. The tuple objects generated by `zip()` are then unpacked into `key` and `value`, which are finally used to create the new dictionary.

Dictionary comprehensions open up a wide spectrum of new possibilities and provide you with a great tool to iterate through a dictionary in Python.
